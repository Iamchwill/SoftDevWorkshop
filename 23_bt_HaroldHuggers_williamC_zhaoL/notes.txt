K23 - No.2? Bootstrapping with no Foundation
2021-12-02

DISCO
- 

QCC
- I only know how to manipulate images as cards from the tutorial.
- What can you style for plain images?

Q0
- Tutorial showed a good amount of features and didn't need additional sources
- Could infer/test customization options.
- Had to look up a bit to see what other ways of customization was available

Q1
- Bootstrap was easier to use with the website tutorial given by other duo. Cards seem versatile and easy to use. I like Bootstrap's grid format better than Foundation's. Foundations docs have more info on each function which I like, but I was still confused by it. Foundation has animations, but I couldn't get those to work.
